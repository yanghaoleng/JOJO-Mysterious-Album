// ---------------------------------------------------------------
// MARBLES — the third game, and the first one made of the molded
// characters.
//
// THE LOOP
//   A tide of small dark things walks down a toy tray toward a red
//   line. You hold three living marbles. You pull one back, let go,
//   and it slides: it CRUSHES everything small it rolls over, BOUNCES
//   off the rails and off the brutes, and wherever it stops it PLANTS
//   and starts fighting on its own, for ever, like a turret you threw.
//
//   And if it strikes one of YOUR marbles on the way, that marble
//   fires its one big move and is sent sliding itself — which can
//   strike a third. That is the chain, it is the only skill in the
//   game, and everything else exists to make it legible.
//
//   Kill enough and you level: three cards, take one. Let enough over
//   the line and the run is over.
//
// WHY IT CAN AFFORD HUNDREDS OF ENEMIES: a small enemy is not a
// physics body (see `mfoes.js`). The solver only ever has a dozen
// circles in it, and only while a throw is live. Between throws the
// physics costs nothing at all.
//
// WHAT LIVES WHERE
//   mtable.js   the set, the camera, screen ↔ floor
//   mfoes.js    the tide
//   mphys.js    momentum, the hook, the chain
//   mcombat.js  the five verbs an ability is written in
//   mkinds.js   the roster — stats and drawing, one object
//   mboost.js   the level-up cards
//   mfx.js      the juice
//   msound.js   the toybox
//   THIS FILE   the rules, the run, the hand and the HUD, and nothing
//               else. If something here starts knowing what a marble
//               looks like, it belongs in one of the files above.

const LIVES = 20;                 // how many may cross before the run ends
// 3.6 → 5.4 → 9 → 7.5 → 6, and the history is worth keeping because
// the same number means different things at different tempos. Enemies
// that no longer stop to fight stopped killing marbles, the hand
// became effectively infinite and the game went easy; the hand
// recharging slowly is the one cost a throw has, so it is the first
// DIFFICULTY knob to turn. At 5.4 an auto-played run threw every 5.3
// seconds and did not lose a life for the first two and a half
// minutes; 9 fixed that and overshot into a wait.
//
// But 5.4 was measured against a tide walking at .42 and this one
// walks at .63 (see `TEMPO`), so the seconds are not comparable —
// what matters is the refill against the WALK, and at 6 it is a
// shorter fraction of a crossing than 5.4 ever was. A number tuned at
// one tempo has to be re-measured at another, not carried over.
//
// It is a STARTING number, not a fixed one: `quick hands` is the
// commonest plain card there is, so a run that wants its hand back
// buys it back.
const REFILL = 6;                 // seconds for one empty hand slot to fill

// THEY MELT, and it is the single most important rule in the game.
// How long each kind lasts is `life` in `mkinds.js`; this file only
// runs the clock.
//
// Without it a throw is permanent, so the standing army only ever
// grows: an auto-played run reached FORTY-FIVE marbles inside a
// minute, at which point the tide was annihilated at the far hog line
// and the game was over in the sense that nothing could happen any
// more. Every alternative was worse — a hard cap needs an arbitrary
// rule about which marble to take away, and scaling the tide to out-run
// an unbounded army just moves the same problem later.
//
// Melting fixes it in the fiction rather than in the UI: they are
// glossy little things standing on ice, working hard. At 4.5% a second
// a marble that nothing touches lasts about twenty-two seconds, so a
// player throwing at a normal rate holds a dozen or so on the sheet at
// once — enough to be an army, never enough to be a wall. It is also
// what stops turtling from being a strategy: you cannot stop throwing.

// each other. Spread evenly, inside the boards for even the widest

//     sits on the near rail, which is the bottom edge of the screen —
//     a slingshot needs room BEHIND its anchor and there is none.
//   · measured on the floor, the same drag means different power
//     depending on where on the table you did it, because a pixel is

// on sits at ~76% of the window's height, leaving ~215px of screen
// below it. Full power was not hard on desktop, it was UNREACHABLE:

// any kind's pace changing relative to any other's. This is the knob
