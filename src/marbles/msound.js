// TOYBOX — a box of glossy marbles on a wooden nursery floor.
//
// This is `marbles.html`'s audio, and it is a SIBLING of src/audio.js,
// not a reuse of it. That module's whole register is "a pencil at a
// desk" — graphite, paper, an eraser — and every recipe in it is one
// of those three. Same relationship as src/gloss/ has to src/parts/:
// the same idea (one lazy context, a couple of synth helpers, one
// vocabulary table, a voice cap, per-sound cooldowns) built again in
// a different hand. It shares nothing with audio.js, not even a bus,
// on purpose — two registers glued through one compressor duck each
// other, and a pencil has no business in this room.
//
// The register: hard plastic, hollow wood, a xylophone, a rubber
// squeak. Everything here is a sound a TOY could make. The spells are
// the exception and even they are a toy's IDEA of magic — a thumb
// piano, a struck jar, a kazoo — never a laser and never a choir.
//
// The key is F MAJOR PENTATONIC (F G A C D) and every pitched sound
// that plausibly can be is on it: `select`, `level`, `take`, `frost`,
// `lose`, `wave`, `leak` and the whole music bed. Five notes with no
// semitone between any two of them cannot be stacked wrong, so a
// level-up landing on top of a card riffle and a fireball is still a
// chord — the game is always in tune with itself. `leak` is the one
// sound that has to feel WRONG, and it gets there by detuning two of
// the key's own notes against each other rather than by leaving the
// key: sour, but still this game's sour.
//
// Pure synthesis. No sample files, no fetch, no imports, nothing to
// load. Browsers refuse audio before a user gesture, so the context
// is created lazily by the unlock listeners this module registers for
// itself; game code never thinks about it.
//
// The LEVELS here are measured, not guessed, and `clack` is 0 dB: it
// is the sound you hear most, so everything else is written as a
// distance from it. Roughly: the pick-ups and knocks sit within 4 dB
// of it, `crush` and `hurt` 13-16 dB under, `aim` 30 under, and only
// the big moments go above — `slam` and `boom` +3, `level` and
// `break` +7, `lose` +11. Any recipe can be re-measured by rendering
// it through an OfflineAudioContext (shim window.AudioContext, import
// this module, dispatch a pointerdown, call sfx, startRendering) and
// three of these numbers were fixed that way after being written by
// ear: `wave` was 1.7x the loudest impact in sustained energy, `leak`
// peaked louder than losing a marble, and `hurt` was 21 dB down and
// effectively inaudible in a fight.

// a sheet of ice with a tide walking down it wants something with a

// OSTINATO — a short figure repeating under a slow harmony, so the
// harmony feels like it is being driven somewhere. So:
//
//   PAD      four detuned sawtooth pairs holding the chord. It does not
//            restart on a chord change, it GLIDES — restarting six
//            oscillators every two bars is a wash of attacks and reads
//            as a synth patch changing, not as strings moving.
//   BASS     the chord root on the beat, an octave apart, short.
//   OSTINATO sixteenths through the chord tones. This is the engine.
//   DRUMS    a low boom on 1 and 3, a noise crack on 2 and 4, and
//            sixteenth shakers once it is really going.
//   BRASS    a slow three-note motif over the chord — the "tune" — and
