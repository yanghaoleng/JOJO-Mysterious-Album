// ---------------------------------------------------------------
// THE CLASS PHOTO — a class photo, scored like a poker hand.
//
// THE LOOP
//   Ten children stand on two shelves. You pick FIVE for the photo
//   and press the button. The photo is scored the way a hand of cards
//   is scored: the five make a HAND — a pair, three of a kind, a full
//   house, the whole litter — on whichever trait they share most of,
//   and that hand is worth POINTS × MULTI. Then every child adds their
//   own points, then
//   every OBJECT you own fires in turn and pushes one of the two
//   numbers. Multiply, and that is the shot.
//
//   Two photos a round against a target, three rounds, and after
//   every photo you keep one of two new objects — the engine grows a
//   piece at a time, which is where the fun compounds.
//
// THE FIVE IN THE PHOTO LEAVE FOR GOOD, and five strangers are drawn
// in their place. The five you did NOT pick stay, so the shelf is
// always half faces you have already weighed up and half new ones —
// which is the whole reason to leave a good child behind.
//
// A PERSISTENT CLASS WAS TRIED AND REMOVED. Children used to stay all
// run, earning +8 points a photo as veterans; it made picking the
// same five mathematically optimal, and Alberto played it and said so:
// he always ended up picking the same children. A bonus that grows on
// use is a bonus that punishes variety. The multi now lives entirely
// in the hand ladder and in the objects, which is where it belongs.
//
// THE FLAT PAGE. This is a 2D scene like the editor and the crowd —
// cream stock, an orthographic camera straight on, no orbit and no
// billboards. See ARCHITECTURE.md §6b for why the game room is the
// odd one out, not this.
//
// NO CLOCK. `dt` moves the score animation and the boil. Nothing else
// in this file reads elapsed time.

// THE AXES a hand can be made on, and the choice is not free.
//
// Almost every legible trait in this engine is a species tell — that
// is what a casting profile IS (ARCHITECTURE §8) — so an axis picked
// carelessly scores species under another name and the player learns
// nothing from it. Measured as mutual information with `recipe.species`
// over 200k rolled children: crest .84, mouth .63, tail .53, base .52,
// eyes .50, hair .37 … and `torso.pattern` **.00**, the one legible
// trait no species has an opinion about, drawn on every base.
//
// So: species is the suit, pattern is the honest cross-cut, and eyes
// sit in between — a dog is mostly dot-eyed but a human rolls dot 16%
// of the time, so it still crosses.
//
// `mouth` was here and is gone: it leaked the most of the three AND
// its five commonest values (wobble, tiny, smirk, frown, grit) are all
// one thin wiggly line at the size these are drawn, so "mouths · a
// pair" was a hand the player could not check.
//
// `nul` is a value that means ABSENCE. Three children with no pattern
// are not three of a kind of anything.
//
// The trait comes FIRST and the hand second — "dogs · three of a kind".
// The other way round, English hands do not compose: "four of a kind of
// dogs" is not a sentence anybody says.
