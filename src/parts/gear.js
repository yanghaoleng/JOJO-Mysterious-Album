// GEAR — the objects a character is actually carrying.
//
// These are the join between the item system and the rig. They own no
// art of their own: an item family draws itself ONCE (in `REF` space,
// origin at its anchor) and these parts plant that same drawing on a
// body. The sword on the draft card and the sword in the fist are
// literally the same strokes.
//
// The params are deliberately tiny — `{ family, rank, seed }` — and
// the rolled shape is derived from them, so a recipe stays small and
// JSON-clean and the editor's pickers all work: change the family and
// you get a different object, change the rank and you get the same
// object drawn in a better medium.
//
// WHY THE BONE IS AT THE SHOULDER. A held thing has to follow the arm
// through every pose, and bones are flat siblings — there is no
// parenting in the rig. So the gear bone is placed at EXACTLY the
// arm's origin and `anim.js` hands it the arm's finished transform.
// The item is then drawn at the hand's own coordinates, which
// `layout.js` publishes as `B.grip(side)`. Rotating about the
// shoulder is what an arm does, so the item swings correctly for free
// — including in poses nobody has written yet.
