// ---------------------------------------------------------------
// KINDERGRIMM — walk them through the dark, and wait for the ones
// who stopped to fight.
//
// THE LOOP
//   You have ONE verb: tap the floor and the whole class walks there.
//   That is the entire control scheme. Everything else is something
//   the children decide, and there is only one thing they decide:
//
//   A child that can SEE a nightmare on it plants its feet and fights
//   until one of them is finished — and does not move while it does.
//   So the group tears itself in half every time you cross something,
//   and you either wait for the stragglers or walk on and leave them
//   out there. That waiting IS the game.
//
//   LIGHT IS NOT A WEAPON AND NOT A SHELTER. It does exactly one
//   thing: you can see. It does not slow a nightmare, it does not
//   hurt one, and standing in it costs nothing. But a child cannot
//   fight what it cannot see, so the lamps decide which of two games
//   you are playing at any moment: in the light you stand and fight,
//   in the dark you run — an unengaged child can always be walked
//   away from something it never saw.
//
//   A HAND HOLDS A LAMP OR A WEAPON, NEVER BOTH. That is the whole
//   composition problem: too many lamps and nothing dies, too many
//   bats and half the class is blind.
//
//   Nightmares hunt the CHILDREN now. They do not bite and nobody is
//   hurt — they frighten, energy runs out, and a child with none left
//   is collected by its parents. Every one you drive off fills the
//   bar; when it fills the world STOPS and a hand of five objects is
//   dealt, of which you keep one.
//
//   The floor has no edge. It goes on in every direction, and the
//   other children are out there somewhere — you find them by walking
//   into the dark until you hear one.
//
// THE VIEW is 3D: floor on XZ, orbiting orthographic camera, and
// every upright drawing a billboard yawed to face it. See
// ARCHITECTURE.md §6b.
